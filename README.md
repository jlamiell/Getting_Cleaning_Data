#Class Project for "Getting and Cleaning Data"

The project required reading the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set from
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

This data set should be extracted into the R working directory.

An R script called run_analysis.R can be executed to:
* Merge training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extract only the mean and standard deviation measurements. 
* Use descriptive activity names to name the data set activities.
* Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 

From this data set (data_set.txt), create a tidy data set (tidy_data.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
